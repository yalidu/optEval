Compiling :
Run make in the current direcotory to compile the library. To test the library (libOptSpace.a) run make in the testing/ directory and run test. To test the library in MATLAB, run make in the testing/ directory and run testing.m in MATLAB.


Please refer to comments in (OptSpace.h) for usage.Also, refer to "Matrix Completion from a Few Entries" (http://arxiv.org/pdf/0901.3150) for details about the algorithm.
